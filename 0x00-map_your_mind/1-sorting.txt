Create pseudo code that reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order.

1.  Give the three numbers variables Num1, Num2 and Num3.
2.  Read the three numbers.
3.  Check if Num1 is less than both Num2 and Num3 then  print the result.
4.  Check if Num1 is less than both Num3 and Num2 then  print the result.
5.  Check if Num2 is less than both Num1 and Num3 then  print the result.
6.  Check if Num2 is less than both Num3 and Num1 then  print the result.
7.  Check if Num3 is less than both Num2 and Num1 then  print the result.
8.  Otherwise print the result.
