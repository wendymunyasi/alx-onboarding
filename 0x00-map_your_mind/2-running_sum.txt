Create a pseudocode where a user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum
and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the
final result

1.  Initialize the Sum of the values as zero.
2.  Create a While Loop that runs only while True.
3.  Inside the While Loop get input from the user and assign it a variable eg Val.
4.  Check if Val is less than 0.
6.  If Val is less than zero then break the loop.
7.  Display the final result of Sum plus Val.
